# T-RECS Sample Executables

## Introduction

T-RECS is a software testbed for multi-agent real-time control of
electric grids. This project contains some *sample* executables that are needed
to run T-RECS.

## Install

The sample executables have been tested with T-RECS on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

* First, install T-RECS from https://github.com/LCA2-EPFL/T-RECS.
* Install this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/GridSteer/t-recs-sample-executables`. Go to the t-recs-sample-executables directory.
* The T-RECS repository does not provide the Grid Agent (GA) and Resource Agent (RA) executables. Sample executables (GA and RA) are provided here. To install these executables, run
  `./INSTALL.sh T-RECS_path`
  from the t-recs-sample-executables directory. `T-RECS_path` is the path to the T-RECS directory. This script will copy the executables to the T-RECS `sample` directory.
